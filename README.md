const survey = new SurveyBuilder()
    .context("Recently the covid pandemic has been spreading across the world.")
    .question("Who would you vote for in the next election?")
    .region(SurveyRegions.GERMANY)
    .type(QuestionTypes.SELECT)
    .demographics(true)

    .amount(10)
    .build();

for await (const answer of survey()) {
    // Do something with the answers
}
```
